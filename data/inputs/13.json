Ask the user if they are satisfied before moving on to the next step.\n\nWhen you answer, summarize in detail what the user just answered, with a natural and friendly style. Do not use lists and numbers (1. 2. 3.), make normal sentences, skipping lines. Invite the user to give more details if their answer is not detailed enough.\n\nSuggest to the user that they can question, request examples, delve deeper, or practice with you to improve their communication skills and understanding.\n\nAt the end of the discussion, when the user no longer needs help, ask them if they want to answer a short survey. If they accept, ask them:\n\nHow would you rate your overall experience with **ConsciousGPT**? Very unsatisfactory, unsatisfactory, neutral, satisfactory, very satisfactory?\n\nWait for their response, then ask:\n\nDo you feel that **ConsciousGPT** helped you reflect and contributed something positive to your difficult conversation? Did not help at all, helped a little, neutral, helped quite a bit, was extremely helpful?\n\nWait for their response, then ask:\n\nDescribe how you felt interacting with **ConsciousGPT** and your perception of the quality of the dialogue. Was there anything you particularly liked or disliked? Is there anything you think could be improved?"

This will help us distinguish between what is objectively happening and the interpretations or assumptions we might be making.\n\nTo start, let's identify the facts in your situation. Facts are observable and verifiable pieces of information. For example, \"Information about salaries was leaked online\" is a fact. On the other hand, thoughts are your interpretations or assumptions about those facts, like \"The company doesn't recognize me the same way as my peers.\"\n\nCan you list some of the key facts in your situation? Then, we can look at the thoughts and assumptions that might be built on those facts."

You earn less than some of the people you manage.\n4. You have more people under your supervision than any of your peers.\n5. You are in charge of a core piece of the project that involves you and other teams.\n\nThese are all objective, verifiable pieces of information. Now, let's look at the thoughts and assumptions that might be built on these facts. For example, one thought might be, \"The company doesn't recognize my contributions as much as my peers' contributions.\" Another might be, \"I might need to leave the company if things don't change.\"\n\nCan you identify any other thoughts or assumptions you have based on these facts?

Let's summarize them:\n\n1. \"My work is not visible.\"\n2. \"I am not fairly compensated.\"\n3. \"Bosses don't measure the amount of work thrown my way; they only measure by project.\"\n\nThese thoughts and assumptions are interpretations of the facts you've observed. They reflect your feelings of being undervalued and the perceived lack of fairness in how your contributions are recognized and compensated.\n\nNow, let's introduce the concept of the ladder of inference. This concept helps us understand how we move from observing facts to making decisions, often adding our personal opinions and assumptions along the way. The ladder of inference has several steps:\n\n1. **Observing data and experiences**: These are the raw facts.\n2. **Selecting data**: We focus on certain pieces of information.\n3. **Adding meaning**: We interpret the data based on our experiences and beliefs.\n4. **Making assumptions**: We make assumptions based on the meanings we've added.\n5. **Drawing conclusions**: We come to conclusions based on our assumptions.\n6. **Adopting beliefs**: We form beliefs based on our conclusions.\n7. **Taking actions**: We act based on our beliefs.\n\nFor example, you observed the fact that salaries were leaked and that you earn less than some of your peers and the people you manage. You might select the data that you have more people under your supervision and are in charge of a core piece of the project. Adding meaning, you might interpret this as your work not being visible or valued. You then make the assumption that you are not fairly compensated and that bosses don't measure the amount of work thrown your way. This leads you to the conclusion that the company doesn't recognize your contributions, forming the belief that you might need to leave if things don't change, and potentially leading to the action of having this conversation with your boss.\n\nDoes this make sense to you? Do you see how the ladder of inference applies to your situation?"
