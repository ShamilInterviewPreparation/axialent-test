This will help you present your case more effectively by distinguishing between what is objectively happening and your interpretations or assumptions about those events.\n\nThe ladder of inference is a mental model that explains how we move from observing facts to making decisions, often adding our personal opinions and assumptions along the way. It starts with observable data, then moves to selecting data, interpreting it, making assumptions, drawing conclusions, and finally taking actions based on those conclusions.\n\nCan you identify the observable facts in your situation, separate from your thoughts and assumptions?

The company has a preference for external hires over internal promotions.\n2. There is a lack of proper documentation of achievements, which affects the ability to defend performance scores during reviews.\n\nThese are observable and objective points that you can bring into your conversation. Now, let's consider the thoughts and assumptions that might be layered on top of these facts. For example, you might think that the VP doesn\u2019t care about losing tenured team members, or that your voice isn\u2019t respected.\n\nCan you identify any other thoughts or assumptions you might have about the situation?

            "content": "That's a valuable insight. Your assumption is that the VP might not be fully aware of the hard work and contributions of the team members because this information isn't being communicated effectively. This assumption could be influencing how you perceive his decisions and responses.\n\nSo, to summarize, we have the observable facts:\n- The company prefers external hires over internal promotions.\n- There is a lack of proper documentation of achievements, affecting performance reviews.\n\nAnd we have the thoughts and assumptions:\n- The VP doesn\u2019t care about losing tenured team members.\n- Your voice isn\u2019t respected.\n- The VP might not be aware of the team\u2019s hard work due to poor communication.\n\nUnderstanding these distinctions can help you approach the conversation more objectively and constructively.

Now that we have a clear understanding of the facts and the assumptions, let's focus on how to have a productive conversation and understand the VP's perspective.\n\nTo have a productive conversation, it's important to share your thoughts openly while staying receptive to the other person's views. Here are some key strategies:\n\n1. **Start with the facts:** Begin the conversation by presenting the observable facts. This helps to ground the discussion in objective reality and can make it less likely for the VP to become defensive.\n\n2. **Express your concerns and values:** Share your unexpressed thoughts and feelings, and explain the fundamental values that are being affected. This can help the VP understand the deeper significance of the issue.\n\n3. **Invite the VP\u2019s perspective:** Ask open-ended questions to understand the VP\u2019s viewpoint. This shows that you\u2019re willing to listen and consider his perspective, which can make him more receptive to your points.\n\n4. **Stay calm and composed:** Given that the VP tends to become less receptive when agitated, maintaining a calm and composed demeanor is crucial. This can help keep the conversation constructive.\n\n5. **Seek common ground:** Look for areas of agreement or mutual interest. For example, both of you likely want the company to succeed and retain valuable employees. Emphasizing common goals can help bridge differences.\n\nWould you like to practice how you might start this conversation, or is there a particular part of the conversation you\u2019re most concerned about?
