My proposal is to explore this new role with a clear focus on how it can drive efficiency and support our business continuity. For example, by utilizing the Leader's technical expertise, we could streamline certain processes and potentially reduce the need for external resources, ultimately saving costs in the long run.\"\n\n**Client:** \"That sounds interesting, but I'm concerned about the immediate increase in costs. How do you propose we manage that?\"\n\n**You:** \"I appreciate that concern. One approach could be to start with a pilot phase where we closely monitor the impact of this new role on our operations and costs. We can set specific KPIs to measure its effectiveness and ensure it aligns with our cost-cutting goals. Additionally, I'm open to discussing any adjustments or alternative solutions that you think might work better.\"\n\n**Client:** \"That makes sense.
