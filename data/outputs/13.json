The ladder of inference can be a bit abstract at first, but it's a useful tool for understanding how we move from facts to actions by adding our own interpretations and assumptions.\n\nNow that we've explored the facts and the thoughts built on those facts, let's focus on how to have a productive conversation with your boss. The goal is to share your thoughts openly while staying receptive to your boss's perspective.\n\nHere are some key points to consider for a productive conversation:\n\n1. **Start with the facts**: Begin by sharing the objective facts you've identified. This sets a neutral ground for the discussion.\n2. **Express your feelings and thoughts**: Share how these facts have made you feel and the thoughts you've had. Be honest but also respectful.\n3. **Connect to your core values**: Explain how this situation affects your sense of fairness and feeling valued.\n4. **Stay open and curious**: Be prepared to listen to your boss's perspective and understand their point of view.\n5. **Seek a collaborative solution**: Aim to work together with your boss to find a solution that addresses your concerns.\n\nWould you like to practice how you might start this conversation, or is there a particular part of the conversation you feel uncertain about and would like some guidance on?"
