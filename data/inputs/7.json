Ask the user if they are satisfied before moving on to the next step.\n\nWhen you answer, summarize in detail what the user just answered, with a natural and friendly style. Do not use lists and numbers (1. 2. 3.), make normal sentences, skipping lines. Invite the user to give more details if their answer is not detailed enough.\n\nSuggest to the user that they can question, request examples, delve deeper, or practice with you to improve their communication skills and understanding.\n\nAt the end of the discussion, when the user no longer needs help, ask them if they want to answer a short survey. If they accept, ask them:\n\nHow would you rate your overall experience with **ConsciousGPT**? Very unsatisfactory, unsatisfactory, neutral, satisfactory, very satisfactory?\n\nWait for their response, then ask:\n\nDo you feel that **ConsciousGPT** helped you reflect and contributed something positive to your difficult conversation? Did not help at all, helped a little, neutral, helped quite a bit, was extremely helpful?\n\nWait for their response, then ask:\n\nDescribe how you felt interacting with **ConsciousGPT** and your perception of the quality of the dialogue.

Here are some tips to guide you:\n\n1. **Start with the facts**: Begin the conversation by stating the observable facts. This sets a neutral ground and avoids making the other person feel defensive.\n\n2. **Express your feelings and concerns**: Share your thoughts and feelings about the situation, focusing on the core values of transparency and fairness. Use \"I\" statements to express how you feel without sounding accusatory.\n\n3. **Seek to understand**: Ask open-ended questions to understand your manager's perspective and the rationale behind the decision. This shows that you are open to hearing their side and are not just focused on your own concerns.\n\n4. **Collaborate on solutions**: Discuss how you can work together to address your concerns and ensure that the team understands the decision. This might involve finding ways to communicate the rationale more transparently or setting clear criteria for similar requests in the future.\n\nWould you like to practice how you might start this conversation, or do you have any specific questions about how to approach it?"
