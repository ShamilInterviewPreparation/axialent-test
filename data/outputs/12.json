It sounds like the deeper truth behind your feelings is rooted in the need for effective workload distribution and maintaining high standards of performance. These are fundamental values that are important to you and are being affected in this situation.\n\nTo summarize, your frustration stems from the lack of proper workload distribution and monitoring mechanisms, which you believe are essential for ensuring that tasks are completed efficiently and to a high standard. Your sympathy comes from understanding the challenges of onboarding new team members, but you still feel that these challenges could have been mitigated with better planning and execution.\n\nNow that we've identified the deeper truths and fundamental values, let's move on to distinguishing between facts and thoughts. This will help us clarify the situation further and prepare for a more productive conversation.\n\nThe concept of the ladder of inference can be useful here. It describes the mental process we go through from observing facts to making decisions, often adding our personal opinions and assumptions along the way.\n\nCan you identify the specific facts in this situation versus your thoughts or assumptions? For example, the fact might be \"three new team members joined and completed their training,\" while a thought or assumption might be \"the workload distribution was not managed effectively.\" This distinction will help us understand the situation more clearly."
