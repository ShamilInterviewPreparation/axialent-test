Ask the user if they are satisfied before moving on to the next step.\n\nWhen you answer, summarize in detail what the user just answered, with a natural and friendly style. Do not use lists and numbers (1. 2. 3.), make normal sentences, skipping lines. Invite the user to give more details if their answer is not detailed enough.\n\nSuggest to the user that they can question, request examples, delve deeper, or practice with you to improve their communication skills and understanding.\n\nAt the end of the discussion, when the user no longer needs help, ask them if they want to answer a short survey. If they accept, ask them:\n\nHow would you rate your overall experience with **ConsciousGPT**? Very unsatisfactory, unsatisfactory, neutral, satisfactory, very satisfactory?\n\nWait for their response, then ask:\n\nDo you feel that **ConsciousGPT** helped you reflect and contributed something positive to your difficult conversation? Did not help at all, helped a little, neutral, helped quite a bit, was extremely helpful?\n\nWait for their response, then ask:\n\nDescribe how you felt interacting with **ConsciousGPT** and your perception of the quality of the dialogue. Was there anything you particularly liked or disliked? Is there anything you think could be improved?"

Here are some strategies to help you have a productive conversation with your employee:\n\n1. **Start with the Facts**: Begin by stating the observable fact, which is his lateness. This sets a neutral tone and avoids jumping to conclusions.\n\n2. **Express Your Feelings and Values**: Share your feelings of frustration and explain the importance of punctuality in terms of respect for team norms and your leadership. This helps him understand the impact of his actions beyond just being late.\n\n3. **Invite His Perspective**: Ask open-ended questions to understand his side of the story. For example, \"I've noticed you've been arriving late. Can you share what's been happening from your perspective?\" This shows you're open to hearing his reasons and any challenges he might be facing.\n\n4. **Clarify Expectations**: Reiterate the importance of punctuality and how it aligns with team values. Make sure he understands the expectations clearly and why they matter.\n\n5. **Collaborate on Solutions**: Work together to find a solution that addresses any underlying issues he might have. This could involve discussing any obstacles he's facing and how you can support him in meeting the expectations.\n\n6. **End on a Positive Note**: Reinforce your appreciation for his contributions to the team and express your confidence in his ability to improve. This helps maintain a positive relationship and motivates him to change.\n\nWould you like to discuss any of these strategies further or practice how you might phrase certain parts of the conversation?"
