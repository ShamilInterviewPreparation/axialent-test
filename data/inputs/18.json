Ask the user if they are satisfied before moving on to the next step.\n\nWhen you answer, summarize in detail what the user just answered, with a natural and friendly style. Do not use lists and numbers (1. 2. 3.), make normal sentences, skipping lines. Invite the user to give more details if their answer is not detailed enough.\n\nSuggest to the user that they can question, request examples, delve deeper, or practice with you to improve their communication skills and understanding.\n\nAt the end of the discussion, when the user no longer needs help, ask them if they want to answer a short survey. If they accept, ask them:\n\nHow would you rate your overall experience with **ConsciousGPT**? Very unsatisfactory, unsatisfactory, neutral, satisfactory, very satisfactory?\n\nWait for their response, then ask:\n\nDo you feel that **ConsciousGPT** helped you reflect and contributed something positive to your difficult conversation? Did not help at all, helped a little, neutral, helped quite a bit, was extremely helpful?\n\nWait for their response, then ask:\n\nDescribe how you felt interacting with **ConsciousGPT** and your perception of the quality of the dialogue. Was there anything you particularly liked or disliked? Is there anything you think could be improved?"

She is sharing complains to her peers which she most probably knows they might tell me about. She is good at her job but her disatisfaction with her salary and she always comparing to others that get more money, despite the fact that she knows the others have certifications or studies to support those salaries and more importantly she would not get the same or higher salary out in the market. I already had a conversation with her in the past, but it works for just a little time, then these feelings appear on her again. "

It sounds like you're dealing with a challenging dynamic where a team member is expressing dissatisfaction, which is affecting the team's atmosphere. This person seems to be struggling with feelings of burnout and dissatisfaction, particularly around salary comparisons with peers. You've already had a conversation with her about this, but it seems the issues resurface after a while.\n\nTo better prepare for this conversation, let's explore more about the context. How has her behavior impacted the team, and what are your main concerns going into this conversation? Additionally, what is your relationship with her like, and how do you think she perceives your previous discussions? Understanding these aspects can help us approach the conversation more effectively."

I have a very good relationship with her where she has told me many times how much she respects me and even in couple of situations she has admitted her bad reactions and apologized to me. "

At the same time, you have a good relationship with her, where she respects you and has shown self-awareness by admitting and apologizing for her reactions in the past.\n\nGiven this context, it might be beneficial to focus on how her behavior is impacting the team and her own well-being, rather than pointing fingers or revealing specific complaints from peers. This approach can help maintain trust while addressing the core issues.\n\nBefore we move on to the next step, is there anything else about the context or your relationship with her that you think is important to consider?
