Imagine you're sitting down with her, and you want to open the conversation in a way that sets a positive tone and invites mutual understanding.\n\nYou might start with something like this:\n\n\"Hey [Cousin's Name], I really value our relationship and I want us to have a strong emotional connection and mutual respect. There have been a few times when I've felt hurt and frustrated during our conversations, and I think it's important for us to talk about it. For example, the other night when I didn't remember what our uncle said and you got upset, I felt disrespected and belittled. I know you probably didn't mean to make me feel that way, but it really affected me. Can we talk about how we can communicate better and support each other more?\"\n\nHow does that feel to you? Would you like to adjust any part of it, or add anything specific? Let's refine it together so you feel confident and prepared."
